# OpenTalkware

OpenTalkware was relocated from GoogleCode https://code.google.com/archive/p/opentalkware/.

## Original Pitch

### Developing Open Talks The Open Source Way

Welcome

S5 allows slideshows to be created from nothing more than HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This means that source is textual and so plays very well with subversion. Being HTML, the latest version of each presentation is automatically available online as the URL.

Developing talks the open source way makes a lot of sense. Readers can contribute back patches, track issues or subscribe to feeds as the talks are updated. Releases can be cut for particular events. Collaboration is easy.
Permissive Licensed Talks

Talks contributed to this project do not require share alike.

Google prefers pure licensing. This means each project chooses licenses for documentation and for code. Permissive BSD CC-BY licenses have been chosen for the source in this repository. A second repository will be used for share alike licensed talks.
### Get Involved

OpenTalkWare is bootstrapping so it's a great time to GetInvolved
### Improve A Talk

Create an issue in the tracker. It's often easier to create a patch once you get the hang of it.
### Change A Talk

Checkout the talk and start remixing!

Change everything except the attributions. These should be clearly marked. If you want to add some attributions of your own, just add more content to these areas, or just create similar sections of your own - just make sure they're clearly marked.

Take a look at Creative Commons for more information about the creative commons licenses and open content. It'll change your world.
### Create A New Talk

To develop a talk, install Subversion and

svn checkout http://opentalkware.googlecode.com/svn/latest/

This will check out the latest version of all the talks together with the UI. Copy Template.
